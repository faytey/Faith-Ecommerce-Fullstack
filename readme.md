# Advanced React & GraphQL Tutorial By Wesbos

Here I worked on my own version to test my skills in fullstack development.

## Working on this Project

It gets really challenging and difficult but i always get help from Mr. Bright at colab and Mr. Tobi from colab. Because i use linux ubuntu OS and i'm working on this project in august 2022, the steps are a bit different and some dependencies and methods needs to be updated or changed. All in all it is a great experience working on this project, go through it and reach out to me with your feedbacks [at my email](faithroberts708@gmail.com). 
Thanks.
