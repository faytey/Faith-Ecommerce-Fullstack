# Advanced React & GraphQL

Here I worked on my own version to test my skills in fullstack development.

## Getting Help

I got help during this project from Mr. Bright at colab and Mr. Tobi from colab. Because i used linux ubuntu OS and i did the project august 2022, the steps were a bit different and some dependencies and methods were changed. All in all it is a great experience working on this project, go through it and reach out to me with your feedbacks [at my email](faithroberts708@gmail.com). Thanks.
